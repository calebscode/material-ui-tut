I followed a video series by Net Ninja on YouTube, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KEpWHtG10M&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gjxLvV4VEkZ6H6H4yWuS58).

Note that it uses old versions of React, react-router-dom, and MUI v5 instead of MUI v6. Several changes were made both out of necessity and creative liberty.
